# jobHuntr

The jobHuntr app (awful name, I know) is a CRUD app that will help job hunters keep track of companies that they have applied to. It will allow users to: Create a company/role, Read that company/role from a database, Update the company/role with any changes and Delete the company/role if it is no longer needed.
